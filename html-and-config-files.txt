## Additional Configuration Files

### package.json
This file was already included in the previous artifact, but here's a reminder of what it contains:
- Dependencies for React, RSS parsing, sentiment analysis, etc.
- Scripts for development, building, and deployment
- Configuration for GitHub Pages deployment

### public/favicon.ico and logo files
For these files, you would typically need to create and include:
- favicon.ico (16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixel versions)
- logo192.png (192x192 pixels)
- logo512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can create these using any image editing software or online favicon generators with a simple sun icon to match the app's theme.
